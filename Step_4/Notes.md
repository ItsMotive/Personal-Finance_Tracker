# Part 4: Data Visualization and Reporting

## Step 1: Create Visual Reports
    • Income vs. Expenses:
        1. Generate a bar or line chart comparing monthly income to expenses.
        2. Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting.

    • Category-Wise Expense Breakdown:
        1. Create a pie chart or bar chart showing the distribution of expenses across different categories.

    • Savings Progress:
        1. Display progress toward savings goals using progress bars or line charts.

## Step 2: Integrate Reports into the GUI
    • Report Generation:
        1. Add a “Reports” section to the GUI where users can select a report type and view the corresponding visualizations. Allow users to save or print these reports.
