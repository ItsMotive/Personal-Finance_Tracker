# Part 3: Implementing the Application

## Step 1: Build the GUI with Tkinter
    • Create the Main Window:
        1. Set up the main application window using Tkinter.
        2. Add navigation options for Income, Expenses, Savings, and Reports.

    • Income Tracker:
        1. Create a form for users to input their income source, amount, and date.
        2. Add a button to submit the form, saving the data to the database.
        3. Display a list of all income entries.

    • Expense Tracker:
        1. Create a form for users to input their expenses, including category, amount, date, and description.
        2. Add a button to submit the form, saving the data to the database.
        3. Display a list of all expenses, allowing users to filter by category.

    • Savings Goals:
        1. Create a form for users to set savings goals, including the goal name, target amount, and target date.
        2. Add a button to submit the form, saving the data to the database.
        3. Display a progress bar or percentage showing progress toward each savings goal.

## Step 2: Implement Data Storage and Retrieval
    • Database Operations:
        1. Implement functions to interact with the SQLite database, such as adding new records, retrieving data, and updating records. Ensure data integrity and validation (e.g., no negative amounts, valid dates).
